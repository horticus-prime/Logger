### Description of Project

In order to increase gardening productivity and to conserve water resources, we have decided to remotely monitor moisture content of soil over time. We will utilize a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with a Grove Moisture Sensor achieve this. The Raspberry Pi will collect moisture sensor data via a direct connection and post at regular intervals to Heroku via a network connection. We have not yet decided what interval at which the data will be posted. The Heroku server will store the collected data in a MongoDB.

We plan on implementing authorization of users and associated capabilities including protecting CRUD routes.

In the future, when the moisture drops below and/or about a certain defined threshold, the app will send a message to the user.

Another possible future feature will incorporate a weather API that will alter the amount of water and/or when to water the plant.

We will design the system for sensor scalability which could include but are not limited to additional moisture sensors, temperature, humidity and sun-light sensors.

### Technologies Utilized 

VSCode, Trello, Github, git, Node.js, Express, Raspberry Pi, a Grove Moisture Sensor, and third-party libraries as necessary.
